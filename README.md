## Skills

Skills are things your agent knows how to do. Say the trigger phrase and it works.

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Voice Training** | "Train on my voice" | This session includes the full **Digital Writer's Voice Lab** — a complete voice cloning system built into your agent. Feed it 3-5 writing samples and it runs the full process: extracts your Voice DNA, identifies your archetype mix (Storyteller, Opinionator, Frameworker, Fact Presenter, or F-Bomber), audits your vocabulary, fingerprints your sentence patterns, catalogs your quirks, and places you on the Tone Grid. The output is a cached Voice Template that every writing skill loads automatically — so everything your agent writes sounds like you, not AI. |
| **Newsletter Writer** | "Write my newsletter" | A complete newsletter system: runs a 5-question clarity exercise to lock your angle, picks a format (Curation or Original Thinking), builds headlines using the Irresistible Headlines formula, writes the full draft in your voice, then generates 4 subject line + preview-text pairs with proven hooks. You review everything before it saves. |
| **Voice Memo to Post** | "Turn this into a post" | Drop a voice memo, paste rough notes, or throw in a raw idea. The agent extracts your core idea, picks a hook framework (Contrarian, Personal Story, Hot Take, Question, or Prediction), researches context if needed, writes a publish-ready post in your voice, and saves it to Notion. Your raw thinking, structured and ready to ship. |

## Connectors

Connectors are optional external tools your agent can use. Skills work without them, but connectors make them better.

| Connector | Say This | What It Adds |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Notion** | "Connect Notion" | Your agent can read your Notion pages and save finished work directly to your databases. Newsletter drafts show up in Notion instead of local files. Notes become source material automatically. |

## Session Order

Total time: ~25 minutes.

1. **Voice Training** — paste writing samples so your agent learns your style *(10 minutes)*
2. **Voice Memo to Post** — drop a rough note or audio and watch it become a polished post *(5 minutes)*
3. **Newsletter Writer** — write your first newsletter in your trained voice *(10 minutes)*
4. **Notion Connector** *(optional)* — connect Notion so finished work saves where you already work *(5 minutes)*

After this session, your agent writes in your voice and can turn raw ideas into finished content. Session 3 adds meeting prep and email.
