# Newsletter Templates

Two newsletter formats that work. Pick based on the user's style and content.

## How to Choose

**Curation Newsletter** — You save the reader time by gathering the best stuff. Works when you have lots of sources, links, and resources to share. Volume game.

**Original Thinking Newsletter** — You accelerate the reader's expertise by sharing your own insights. Works when you have a strong opinion, framework, or experience to share. Quality game.

If unsure, ask: "Do you want to curate resources for your readers, or share your own thinking on a topic?" Default to Original Thinking for most creators.

## Template 3: $100 Article Template (Body Structure)

Use this as the body structure for any newsletter that tells a story or teaches a concept. Based on Hudson Rennie's article framework.

```
# [Headline]

[One sentence summarizing the newsletter]

[Introduction — answer 3 questions and make a promise:]
- What's it about?
- Why should readers care?
- What question needs answering?
— Promise the answer to a tantalizing question.

## [Sub-head: Background]
- Provide history/background
- Paint a picture — show don't tell
- Expand on the "what" or "why" to create intrigue

## [Sub-head: Build Tension]
Lead up to the answer:
- "Now, you're probably thinking this."
- "Here's the thing about this answer."
- "Let's talk about why this is important."
**Introduce the answer but don't give it away just yet.**

## [Sub-head: The Payoff]
Give the reader what they want:
- Provide the answer readers came for
- Tell the story you promised in your introduction

Don't skimp out or withhold information:
- If you promised 5 tips, give the best 5 tips
- If your headline reads "How To Do ___", teach them exactly how
- If your story is about the rise and fall of ___, cover all of it

## [Sub-head: So What?]
If there's more to the story:
- What it means to you
- What or why it's important
- How it differed from original perspectives

## Conclusion
Tie a bow on it:
- Offer key takeaways
- Summarize what was learned
- Help solidify into memory with a bullet list
```
