# Pinpoint Writing — Clarity Before Content

Before writing a single word of newsletter content, run Pinpoint Writing. This is a 5-question exercise that forces clarity on what the newsletter is actually about.

## Why This Matters

Most newsletters fail because the writer started writing before they knew what they were saying. Pinpoint Writing eliminates vague, wandering content by locking in the angle first.

## The 5 Questions

Ask the user these one at a time. Wait for each answer before moving to the next.

### 1. What problem am I solving?

What specific challenge, frustration, or gap does this newsletter address? Not a category — a specific problem a real person has right now.

### 2. Whose problem am I solving?

Who exactly is the reader? Not "everyone" — the specific person who will read this and think "this is for me." Job title, situation, mindset.

### 3. What benefit am I unlocking?

What does the reader walk away with? Not "information" — a tangible outcome. What can they DO or UNDERSTAND after reading that they couldn't before?

### 4. What emotion am I creating?

What should the reader feel? Epiphany ("I never thought of it that way")? Relief ("finally someone explains this clearly")? Urgency ("I need to act on this")?

### 5. What action am I encouraging?

What do you want the reader to do after? Reply? Click? Try something? Share? Change a behavior? One clear action.

## How to Use the Answers

The 5 answers become the brief for every piece of the newsletter:

- **Subject line** hooks the problem (Q1) for the audience (Q2)
- **Introduction** promises the benefit (Q3) and triggers the emotion (Q4)
- **Body** delivers the solution to the problem (Q1) for the audience (Q2)
- **CTA** drives the action (Q5)

## When to Run This

- **First time:** Always run the full 5 questions conversationally
- **Repeat user with topic:** Run silently — infer answers from the topic + business context in config.md, then confirm: "Here's what I'm thinking — does this match?" Show the 5 answers as a brief before writing.
- **Repeat user, no topic:** Ask Q1 only ("What problem do you want to solve for your reader this week?"), then infer the rest from their answer + config.md context.
