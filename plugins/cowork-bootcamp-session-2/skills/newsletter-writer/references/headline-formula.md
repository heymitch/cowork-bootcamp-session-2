# Irresistible Headlines — The 5-Piece Formula

Every newsletter needs a headline (the main idea) and a subject line (the email hook). This formula builds both.

## The 5 Pieces

An "Irresistible Headline" combines up to 5 fundamental pieces. Not every headline uses all 5, but the more you include, the stronger the pull.

### 1. HOW MANY (a number)
Specificity creates credibility. Numbers promise a concrete, scannable payoff.

Examples: 6 tips, 7 reasons, 11 mistakes, 3 steps, 5 lessons

### 2. THE WHO (an audience)
Call out the reader directly so they self-select.

Examples: for project managers, for therapists, for founders, for new parents, for freelancers

### 3. THE WHAT (a noun)
The content type sets expectations for format and depth.

Examples: tips, reasons, mistakes, lessons, examples, templates, case studies, frameworks, rules

### 4. THE WHY (a reason/outcome)
The promised result — what changes after reading.

Examples: to get promoted, to not lose your job, to buy your first house, to land your first client, to save 10 hours a week

### 5. TWIST THE KNIFE (2-3 additional benefits/outcomes)
Stack extra outcomes to make the value impossible to ignore.

Examples: to attract your first 5 high-ticket clients and move into your dream office, to double your revenue and finally take a real vacation

## How the Agent Uses This

1. After Pinpoint Writing, generate 3-5 headline options using this formula
2. Present them to the user with the pieces labeled
3. User picks or combines
4. Winning headline becomes the newsletter title AND the seed for subject line variations

## From Headline to Subject Line

The headline is often too long for a subject line. Compress it:
- Subject lines: **9 words max, 60 characters max**
- Keep the strongest 2-3 pieces from the headline
- The missing pieces move to the preview-text (see `subject-lines.md`)
