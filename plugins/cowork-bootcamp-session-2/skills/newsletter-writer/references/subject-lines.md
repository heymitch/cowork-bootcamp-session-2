# Subject Line Writing — Hook the Open

The subject line gets the open. The preview-text seals it. Together they determine whether anyone reads your newsletter.

## Two Lines, Two Jobs

- **Subject Line** — the main line in the inbox. Hook the reader. Like a note to a friend.
- **Preview-Text (Sub-Text)** — the grey text that follows. The "whisper." Sets expectations for what's inside.

## 4 Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Long subject lines.** If the hook gets cut off before it's revealed, nobody clicks. Keep it short.
2. **Formal tone.** Your email is personal. Casual and clear wins. Write like you're texting a friend, not presenting to a board.
3. **Ineffective hooks.** Use what's been proven to work for 100 years. Promise a lot for a little or instantly. (Then deliver on the promise.)
4. **Ignoring the preview-text.** It's the perfect way to reinforce your hook and set clear expectations without making your subject line too long.

## 4 Proven Subject Line Hooks

Every subject line should lean on one of these:

1. **Value for Time** — "Here's a ton of value for minimal time."
2. **Value for Cost** — "Here's a ton of value for minimal cost."
3. **Effortless Solution** — "Here's how to solve your problem without much effort."
4. **Instant Desirable Outcome** — "Here's how to unlock this desirable outcome, instantly."

## 4 Whisper Types (Preview-Text)

The preview-text "whispers" one of these:

1. **Trust Whisper** — credibility builder. "Written By A Twitter Creator With 100k Followers"
2. **Obstacle Whisper** — removes objection. "Without Spending Any Money On Ads"
3. **Benefit Whisper** — stacks extra value. "And How To Solve It"
4. **Outcome Whisper** — paints the destination. "And Start Earning $250,000 Per Year In Your Sweatpants"

## Subject Line Rules

1. **15 words max.** Ideally under 9 words, 60 characters.
2. **Sentence case.** Like talking to a friend, not writing a headline.
3. **Visceral, tangible language.** Not abstract concepts — concrete, visual words.
4. **Intrigue the reader.** Open a loop they need to close.
5. **Use numbers.** Specific numbers feel real and scannable.
6. **Be super specific.** "3 LinkedIn mistakes" beats "common social media errors."

## Subject Line Examples

Good:
- "Your entire Life Coach career path blueprint... in 1 email!"
- "Here's our entire $1M marketing plan. Steal it!"
- "Losing money in the stock market? Just buy these 3 companies."
- "3 keys to land $10,000 consulting clients, from home, in your pajamas, right now."
- "5 steps to write your first viral Twitter thread (even if you have 0 Followers)"

## How the Agent Writes Subject Lines

After the newsletter draft is written:

1. **Generate 4 subject line options** — one for each hook type (value for time, value for cost, effortless solution, instant outcome)
2. **Generate a whisper for each** — pick the whisper type that best complements the hook
3. **Present all 4 pairs** to the user with the hook type labeled
4. **User picks or combines**
5. **Validate:** Read it out loud. Ask: "Would I open this? Do I want what's inside? What question does this raise for me?"
