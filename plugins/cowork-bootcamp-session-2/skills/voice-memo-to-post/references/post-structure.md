# Post Structure — From Raw Input to Publish-Ready

## The Core Principle

Your raw voice is gold. This process cleans it up without killing what made it yours.

**Preserve:** unique phrases, strong opinions, personal stories, specific examples.
**Remove:** filler words, repetition, tangents that don't serve the point, incomplete thoughts.
**Add:** structure (hook, body, CTA), formatting for the platform, context a reader needs.

## Platform Formats

### LinkedIn Post (Default for longer ideas)
- **Length:** 800-1200 characters
- **Structure:** Hook line → Setup (2-3 sentences) → Body (the meat) → Takeaway → CTA
- **Formatting:** Line breaks between thoughts. Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences). Lists for scanability.
- **CTA:** Ask a question, invite a reply, or point to a resource.

### X/Twitter Single (Default for punchy ideas)
- **Length:** ≤280 characters
- **Structure:** One complete thought. Hook IS the post.
- **Formatting:** No lists. No line breaks unless strategic. Punchy.

### X/Twitter Thread (When the idea needs room)
- **Length:** 5-12 connected posts, each ≤280 chars
- **Structure:** Hook tweet → Supporting points (1 per tweet) → Summary/CTA tweet
- **Thread rule:** Each tweet must stand alone AND flow in sequence.

### Instagram Caption
- **Length:** 500-1000 characters
- **Structure:** Hook line → Story or insight → Takeaway → CTA → Hashtags
- **Formatting:** Emoji as section breaks (sparingly). Short paragraphs.

## How the Agent Picks Platform

If the user didn't specify:

1. **Short, punchy, one idea** → X single post
2. **A story or lesson with depth** → LinkedIn
3. **Multiple connected points** → X thread or LinkedIn (ask which)
4. **Visual-first idea** → Instagram (suggest pairing with an image)

Always confirm: "This feels like a LinkedIn post — want me to draft it there, or somewhere else?"

## Research Enhancement

If the raw input references a trend, news event, or statistic the agent doesn't know:
- Use web search to find current context
- Add a one-line fact or data point to strengthen the post
- Cite the source naturally ("According to [source]..." or weave it in)
- Never fabricate — if search returns nothing useful, write without it

Only research when the post would be stronger with context. Don't add research to personal stories or opinion posts.

## Output Format

Always show:

```
## Original Input
[Raw transcription or pasted notes]

## Draft Post ([Platform])
**Hook Framework:** [Which one was used]

[The full post, formatted for the platform]

---
Character count: [X] / [platform limit]
```

Wait for approval before saving.

## Save Locations

- **Notion connected:** Save to Notion content database with frontmatter (platform, date, status: draft, hook_framework)
- **No Notion:** Save to local `content/YYYY-MM/DD-[slug].md`
