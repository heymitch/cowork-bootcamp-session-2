# Hook Frameworks — Choose the Right Opening

Every post lives or dies on the hook. After extracting the core idea from raw input, pick the framework that gives the idea the most pull.

## The 5 Frameworks

### 1. Contrarian
Challenge the obvious take. Works when everyone agrees on something and you see a blind spot.

Pattern: "Everyone's excited about X. Here's why I'm skeptical..."

Best for: Industry news that has a bandwagon forming, popular advice that's actually wrong, consensus opinions you disagree with.

### 2. Personal Story
Connect the idea to lived experience. Works when the memo already contains a personal anecdote or "this happened to me" energy.

Pattern: "This reminds me of when I..." / "Last week a client told me..."

Best for: Lessons learned, mistakes made, behind-the-scenes moments, client stories (anonymized).

### 3. Hot Take
Strong opinion, stated with conviction. Works when the raw input has heat — frustration, excitement, or a clear stance.

Pattern: "Hot take: This changes everything about..." / "Unpopular opinion: [bold claim]"

Best for: Industry shifts, new tools/announcements, practices that need to die, things people are doing wrong.

### 4. Question
Open with a question that makes the reader think. Works when the core idea is a surprising insight or reframe.

Pattern: "What if [thing] means [unexpected consequence]?" / "Why does nobody talk about [obvious problem]?"

Best for: Reframing problems, surfacing hidden patterns, challenging assumptions, making readers pause.

### 5. Prediction
Project forward from the core idea. Works when the memo touches on trends, change, or "where things are heading."

Pattern: "In 2 years, because of this..." / "This is the beginning of [bigger shift]"

Best for: Trend analysis, technology shifts, market changes, skill evolution.

## How the Agent Picks

1. Read the raw input and identify the dominant energy:
   - Frustration/disagreement → **Contrarian** or **Hot Take**
   - "Let me tell you what happened" → **Personal Story**
   - Curiosity/wondering → **Question**
   - "I see where this is going" → **Prediction**
2. If unclear, present the top 2 frameworks with sample hooks and let the user choose.
3. If the user specified a platform, bias toward what works there:
   - **LinkedIn**: Personal Story and Contrarian perform strongest
   - **X/Twitter**: Hot Take and Question perform strongest
   - **Both work everywhere**: Prediction
