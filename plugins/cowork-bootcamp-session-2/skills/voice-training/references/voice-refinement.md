# Voice Refinement Layers

Each section adds resolution to the Voice DNA. Think of it like increasing picture quality — Voice DNA is the clear image, these layers make it sharper.

## Vocabulary

Words are identity. The words you choose attract (or repel) specific readers.

### The Audit

Analyze writing samples for:
1. Words used frequently
2. Unique phrases or expressions
3. Industry-specific jargon
4. Words consistently avoided

### Three Lists

**Power Words** — Words they love and use often. These should appear in AI output.
Example: leverage, irresistible, proven, wild, obsessed

**Avoid Words** — Words that feel wrong or AI-generic. These must NOT appear.
Example: very, really, just, game-changer, supercharge, delve, landscape, crucial

**Replacement Words** — Better alternatives for common AI defaults.
Example: "use" instead of "utilize", "important" instead of "crucial", "help" instead of "empower"

### How to Apply

Add to the Voice Template as:
```
Vocabulary Preferences:
  - Power Words: [3-5 words]
  - Avoid Words: [3-5 words]
  - Replacement Words: [2-3 pairs, e.g., 'use' instead of 'utilize']
```

Be stingy. Aim for natural integration, not forced word-stuffing.

## Sentences

How you structure sentences makes a big difference in flow and readability.

### The Analysis

For each writing sample, break down:

1. **Sentence length** — Short and punchy? Long and flowing? A mix?
2. **Sentence structure** — Simple, compound, complex? Do they alternate? Build to a crescendo?
3. **Sentence beginnings** — Start with subjects? Verbs? Lead with "But" or "And"?
4. **Transition words** — Which ones appear most? How often?
5. **Rhetorical questions** — Frequency and placement (end of paragraphs? openers?)

### The Sentence Style Guide

Based on analysis, create:
```
Sentence Length: [e.g., Mix of short (5-10 words) and medium (11-20 words)]
Paragraph Length: [e.g., 1-3 sentences max]
Signature Moves: [e.g., Start 20% of sentences with 'But' or 'And', end 25% of paragraphs with questions]
```

Tips for musical writing:
- Short sentences = emphasis, punch, drama
- Long sentences = flow, explanation, nuance
- Alternating = rhythm that keeps readers moving
- One-sentence paragraphs = maximum impact

## Quirks

The little idiosyncrasies that make readers think "that's definitely them."

### Three Angles

**1. Humor**
What's their brand of funny?
- Dry wit
- Self-deprecating
- Witty wordplay
- Sarcasm
- Dad jokes
- None (serious writer — that's a valid quirk too)

**2. Metaphors and Analogies**
The comparisons they draw reveal how they think.
- Sports analogies?
- Cooking metaphors?
- Tech/engineering references?
- Pop culture?
- Everyday objects?

**3. Backstory**
Personal experiences that show up in writing.
- References to growing up somewhere specific?
- Lessons from a first job?
- Industry war stories?
- Travel experiences?
- Family references?

### How to Apply

Add to Voice Template as:
```
Quirk Quotient:
- [2-3 specific quirks, e.g., "Uses cooking metaphors for business concepts"]
- Anecdote Frequency: [e.g., "Include a personal anecdote every 300 words"]
```

Tips:
- Ask others what they notice — sometimes others see your quirks more clearly
- Study your most popular pieces — which quirks are present in best-received work?
- Don't force quirks where they don't fit — authenticity is the point

## Tone Grid

A 2-axis framework (from copywriter Will Hoekenga) for pinpointing tone.

### The Two Axes

**X-axis: Feel** (1 = Loose, 10 = Tight)
- Loose = conversational, casual, relaxed structure
- Tight = polished, precise, crisp structure

**Y-axis: Attitude** (1 = Irreverent, 10 = Professional)
- Irreverent = boundary-pushing, playful, unexpected
- Professional = authoritative, trustworthy, measured

### The Four Quadrants

| Combo | Style | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Loose + Irreverent | Playful | Basecamp: "Not everything under the sun, just the stuff to get things done" |
| Loose + Professional | Laid Back | Friendly expert giving advice |
| Tight + Irreverent | Snappy/Punchy | Bold, concise, unexpected |
| Tight + Professional | Polished | Apple: "Unbelievably thin. Incredibly powerful." |

Most writers sit in the neutral zone (middle of both axes). That's forgettable. The distinct zone is where voice becomes memorable.

### How to Apply

Rate the writer's samples on both axes, then add to Voice Template as:
```
Tone Attributes:
- Feel: [1-10] ([Loose/Tight])
- Attitude: [1-10] ([Irreverent/Professional])
- Quadrant: [Playful/Laid Back/Snappy/Polished]
- Humor Style: [from Quirks analysis]
```

Remember: Tone is not voice. Voice is what you believe. Tone is how you express it. Tone can shift by context (a tweet vs. a proposal) while voice stays constant.
