# Voice DNA Extraction Methodology

The foundation of voice training. Your writing voice has 4 components:

1. **Voice** — The core personality that stays consistent across everything you write
2. **Tone** — The emotional color that changes piece to piece (casual email vs. pitch deck)
3. **Style** — The technical mechanics: word choice, sentence structure, rhythm, POV
4. **Structure** — How you organize thoughts and information

Your unique writing personality exists at the intersection of all four.

## Step-by-Step Extraction

### 1. Separate Voice from Tone

Voice stays consistent. Tone changes. For each writing sample, analyze ONLY voice (the traits that would be present no matter what the writer was writing about).

For each sample, identify a maximum of 10 bullet points of what the writing voice is. Focus on:
- Personality traits that shine through (direct? empathetic? irreverent?)
- Perspective and worldview
- How they relate to the reader
- Level of formality
- Energy and pacing

### 2. Merge Voice Responses

After analyzing all samples, consolidate. Remove duplicates. Keep only unique voice traits in a clean bullet list. These are the traits that appeared across multiple samples — the real signal.

### 3. Isolate Writing Style

Separately from voice, analyze style across these 6 criteria:

1. **Word Choice** — Specific vocabulary and terminology used
2. **Sentence Structure** — How sentences are constructed, including length and complexity
3. **Rhythm and Pacing** — The flow and tempo of the writing
4. **Point of View** — The perspective (first person? second person? mixed?)
5. **Figurative Language** — Metaphors, similes, analogies, literary devices
6. **Imagery** — Descriptive language that creates visual images

### 4. Merge Style Responses

Same as voice: consolidate across all samples, remove duplicates, keep unique style traits.

### 5. Combine into Voice DNA Document

Two refined lists become one document:

```
Voice Attributes:
- [trait 1]
- [trait 2]
- ...

Style Attributes:
- [trait 1]
- [trait 2]
- ...
```

This is the foundation. The refinement steps (vocabulary, sentences, quirks, tone grid) add resolution to this picture.

## Archetypes

Most writers align with one or more of these 5 Voice Archetypes. Identifying the mix helps the agent maintain consistency.

### The 5 Archetypes

**1. The Storyteller**
Loves dates, times, locations, real-life examples. Uses phrases like "In 1999...", "The first time I...", "A few years ago..."

**2. The Opinionator**
Emphasizes strong opinions. Conviction is the theme. Uses "There's a reason why...", "It's unbelievable how...", "It's abundantly clear that...", "Never", "Always". Heavy on adverbs for emphasis: "Really", "Rarely", "Honestly".

**3. The Fact Presenter**
Backs up opinions with stats and research. Uses studies, surveys, research papers, data points. Credibility through evidence.

**4. The Frameworker**
Gives readers something actionable. Moves people from point A to point B with organized ideas. Uses "A Proven Process...", "A Timeless Framework...", "A Simple Checklist..." Names their frameworks.

**5. The F-Bomber**
Abrasive. Pushes boundaries. Cursing, ranting, and sarcasm are the tools.

### Identifying the Mix

Analyze the writing samples against all 5 archetypes. Create a voice mix table:

| Archetype | Percentage |
|-----------|-----------|
| Storyteller | X% |
| Opinionator | X% |
| Fact Presenter | X% |
| Frameworker | X% |
| F-Bomber | X% |

Also note the common combinations:
- Start with an opinion → dive into facts
- Start with a story → lead into a framework
- Start with a story → framework → end with opinion

This mix tells the agent what to edit for. If the user's voice mix is 50% framework and 30% opinion, but a draft comes out 80% storytelling, the agent knows to pull back on stories and add more structure.
